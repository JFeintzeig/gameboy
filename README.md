# Gameboy
A gameboy emulator in go.

# Setup
- The tests assume you have a sibling directory named `gameboy_resources`, into which you've checked out [gameboy-doctor](https://github.com/robert/gameboy-doctor) and [gb-test-roms](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms) in the parent directory, so your directory structure should look like:
  - gameboy/ (this repo)
      - src/
      - ...
  - gameboy_resources/
      - gameboy-doctor/
      - gb-test-roms/
